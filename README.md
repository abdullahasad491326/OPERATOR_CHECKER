### üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to quickly get the application up and running.

1.  **Install Dependencies:** Run `npm install` in your project folder.
2.  **Configure Admin Credentials:** Set your `ADMIN_USERNAME` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD` in `server.js` or using environment variables.
3.  **Start the Server:** Execute `node server.js` to launch the application.

### ‚ú® Features

-   **Admin Dashboard:** A password-protected web interface to manage service settings.
-   **IP Access Control:** Dynamically block and unblock specific IP addresses to control who can access the service.
-   **Simulated SMS Service:** An internal-only API endpoint that logs SMS message attempts and tracks usage without integrating with a real SMS gateway.
-   **SIM Data Lookup:** An endpoint to fetch owner details (name, CNIC, address) from a third-party service based on a mobile number.
-   **Mobile Operator Check:** A proxy endpoint to query a third-party service for the mobile network operator of a given number.

### üìã Prerequisites

-   **Node.js**: [Download & Install](https://nodejs.org/)
-   **npm**: Included with Node.js

### üîß Installation

1.  **Project Structure:**
    Ensure your project folder contains a `server.js` file and a `public` directory with `admin.html` and `Operator.html` inside it.

    ```
    /your-project-folder/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ server.js
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ /public/
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Operator.html
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ admin.html
    ```

2.  **Install project dependencies:**
    Navigate to your project directory in the terminal and run the following command to install all necessary packages:
    ```bash
    npm install express express-session node-fetch jsdom
    ```

### ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

-   **Admin Credentials:**
    The application's admin credentials are set in the `server.js` file. For a production environment, it is highly recommended to use environment variables for sensitive information.

    **Method 1: Direct File Modification**
    Open `server.js` and modify the values for `ADMIN_USERNAME` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD`.

    ```javascript
    // Change these values to your desired username and password
    const ADMIN_USERNAME = 'your-secure-username';
    const ADMIN_PASSWORD = 'your-secure-password';
    ```

    **Method 2: Using Environment Variables (Recommended)**
    To avoid hardcoding credentials, you can use environment variables. Create a `.env` file in your project's root directory and add your credentials there. Then, modify `server.js` to read from these variables.

    `.env` file:
    ```
    ADMIN_USERNAME='your-secure-username'
    ADMIN_PASSWORD='your-secure-password'
    ```

    `server.js` file:
    ```javascript
    // Use an environment variable, falling back to a default if not set
    const ADMIN_USERNAME = process.env.ADMIN_USERNAME || 'default_user';
    const ADMIN_PASSWORD = process.env.ADMIN_PASSWORD || 'default_password';
    ```
    *(Note: This method requires installing the `dotenv` package with `npm install dotenv` and adding `require('dotenv').config()` at the top of your `server.js` file.)*

### üìù Important Note on SMS Functionality

The `/send-sms` endpoint is designed to be a mock service. It logs messages to an in-memory array on the server for tracking purposes but **does not** connect to any real SMS gateway. This behavior is intentional, as per the project's requirements, to avoid external dependencies while still providing a log of attempted sends.
