### üîß Installation & Setup

1.  **Set up the project structure:**
    Create a project folder, then place your `server.js` file inside. Create a `public` subfolder and place `admin.html` and `Operator.html` within it.

    ```
    /your-project-folder/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ server.js
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ /public/
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Operator.html
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ admin.html
    ```

### üìù Important Note on SMS Functionality

The `/send-sms` endpoint is designed to be a mock service. It logs messages to an in-memory array on the server for tracking purposes but **does not** connect to any real SMS gateway. This behavior is intentional, as per the project's requirements, to avoid external dependencies while still providing a log of attempted sends.
